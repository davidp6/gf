```{r setup, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(ggplot2) 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=8)

```

## Hypothesis 1

Prevention programs for the general population, AGYW, and MSM are absorbing more poorly than other KP interventions. 

## Key population absorption, pooled across countries
```{r kp, echo=FALSE, results='hide', fig.keep='all', fig.height=7, fig.width=11}
hiv_absorption = dt[grant_disease%in%c("hiv", 'hiv/tb'), .(budget=sum(cumulative_budget), expenditure=sum(cumulative_expenditure)), by='abbrev_mod']
hiv_absorption[grepl("prevention", tolower(abbrev_mod)), keep:=TRUE]
hiv_absorption[abbrev_mod=="PMTCT", keep:=TRUE]
hiv_absorption[abbrev_mod=="Care & prevention", keep:=FALSE]
hiv_absorption = hiv_absorption[keep==TRUE][order(expenditure/budget)]
plot = budget_exp_bar(hiv_absorption, altTitle="Absorption for KP mods and PMTCT", orderVar='absorption')
plot
```

## Absorption by module and country
![](absorption_by_mod1_edited.png)

## Conclusion for hypothesis 1
Mixed evidence.
Evidence is mixed depending on how data is prepared. There is much variation between countries.  

## Hypothesis 2
KP absorption seems to correlate with size of budget allocation. 

## Absorption for KP mods over first 18 months
```{r kp1, echo=FALSE, results='hide', fig.keep='all'}
plot
```

## Conclusion for hypothesis 2
Confirmed. Although there is some variance, the evidence seems conclusive here, and the relationship between size of budget and absorption percentage has been observed across many parts of the grants. 

## Hypothesis 3
"Preventing human rights barriers to HIV services" has been absorbing poorly

## Absorption for human rights module, by country
```{r human_rights}
plot_data = dt[abbrev_mod=="Human rights barriers", .(budget=sum(cumulative_budget), expenditure=sum(cumulative_expenditure)), by=c('abbrev_mod', 'loc_name')]
print(budget_exp_bar(plot_data, xVar='loc_name', altTitle="Human rights absorption (HIV) by country"))
```

## Absorption by module and country
![](absorption_by_mod1_edited.png)

## Conclusion for hypothesis 3 
Conclusive. "Prevention of human rights barriers" has low absorption whether pooled by module, or by country and module. 

## Hypothesis 4 
RSSH is absorbing more poorly overall than other diseases.

## Absorption by disease area
```{r rssh}
rssh_mods = c("Info systems & M&E", "Financial systems", "HR & health workers", "Service delivery", "Nat. health strategies", "PSM", "Community systems")
hiv_mods = c("Prevention programs for MSM", "Prevention programs for PWID", "Prevention programs for CSW & clients", "Prevention programs for transgender", "Prevention programs for prisoners", "HIV Testing Services", "PMTCT", "Prevention programs for youth/adol.", "Prevention programs for general pop.", "Prevention programs for other KVP", "Human rights barriers", "Treatment, care & support")
malaria_mods = c("Case management", "Specific prev. interventions", "Vector control") 
tb_mods = c("MDR-TB", "Care & prevention", "TB/HIV")
pm_mods = c('Program mgmt')

plot_data = copy(dt)
plot_data[abbrev_mod%in%hiv_mods, disease:="HIV"]
plot_data[abbrev_mod%in%tb_mods, disease:="TB"]
plot_data[abbrev_mod%in%malaria_mods, disease:="Malaria"]
plot_data[abbrev_mod%in%rssh_mods, disease:="RSSH"]
plot_data[abbrev_mod%in%pm_mods, disease:="Program management"]
plot_data[is.na(disease) & abbrev_mod=="Unspecified", disease:="Unspecified"]

plot_data = plot_data[, .(budget=sum(cumulative_budget), expenditure=sum(cumulative_expenditure)), by=c('disease')]
print(budget_exp_bar(plot_data, xVar='disease', altTitle="Absorption by disease area"))
```

## Conclusion for hypothesis 4 
Disproven. Although RSSH does have low absorption at 53%, malaria overall is absorbing at 52%. However, it is worth noting that malaria has a much higher budget than RSSH, which normally correlates with higher absorption. 

## Hypothesis 5 
Information systems and M+E has average absorption, despite having the largest budget of the RSSH interventions. 

## RSSH absorption, pooled across countries
```{r rssh2, results='hide', fig.keep='all', fig.height=7, fig.width=11} 
rssh_mods = c("Info systems & M&E", "Financial systems", "HR & health workers", "Service delivery", "Nat. health strategies", "PSM", "Community systems")
plot_data = dt[abbrev_mod%in%rssh_mods, .(budget=sum(cumulative_budget), expenditure=sum(cumulative_expenditure)), 
               by=c('abbrev_mod')]
budget_exp_bar(plot_data, altTitle="Absorption for RSSH modules", altSubtitle="All contries pooled", orderVar='absorption')

```

## Conclusion for hypothesis 5 
Confirmed. 

## Hypothesis 6
The "integrated service delivery and quality improvement" module has the lowest absorption of RSSH modules. 

## RSSH absorption, pooled across countries
```{r rssh3, results='hide', fig.keep='all', fig.height=7, fig.width=11} 
budget_exp_bar(plot_data, altTitle="Absorption for RSSH modules", altSubtitle="All contries pooled", orderVar='absorption')
```

## Conclusion for hypothesis 6
Confirmed. 

## Hypothesis 7 
Program management has high absorption across countries and grants. 

## Program management absorption, by country 
```{r pm} 
plot_data = dt[abbrev_mod=="Program mgmt", .(budget=sum(cumulative_budget), expenditure=sum(cumulative_expenditure)), by=c('loc_name')]
print(budget_exp_bar(plot_data, xVar=c('loc_name'), altTitle="Program management absorption, by country"))
```

## Absorption by module and country
![](absorption_by_mod1_edited.png)

## Conclusion for hypothesis 7 
Confirmed. Whether pooling by country or country/module, program management has high absorption. 

## Hypothesis 8 
Program management makes up a high percentage of the country-level portfolio. 

## Program management as a percentage of the original budget
```{r pm2, fig.height=7, fig.width=12} 
plot_data = copy(dt)

plot_data[abbrev_mod=="Program mgmt", category:="Program management"]
plot_data[abbrev_mod%in%rssh_mods, category:="RSSH"]
plot_data[abbrev_mod%in%hiv_mods, category:="HIV: General"]
plot_data[abbrev_mod%in%malaria_mods, category:="Malaria: General"]
plot_data[abbrev_mod%in%tb_mods, category:="TB"]
plot_data[abbrev_mod=="Vector control", category:="Malaria: Vector control"]
plot_data[abbrev_mod=="Treatment, care & support", category:="HIV: Treatment, care and support"]
plot_data = plot_data[, .(budget=sum(original_budget, na.rm=T)), by=c('loc_name', 'category')]
plot_data = plot_data[budget!=0] #Data for Mozambique and CAM/MYM isn't showing up here - we don't have original budget data for them. 
plot_data[, total:=sum(budget), by='loc_name']
plot_data[, pct:=round((budget/total)*100, 1)]
plot_data[, label:=paste0(pct, "%")]

p = ggplot(plot_data, aes(x=loc_name, y=pct, fill=category, label=label)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="stack") + 
  geom_text(position=position_stack(vjust=0.5), size=4) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(title="Percentage of each budget that is program management", fill="", y="Percentage of proposed budget for first 18 months", x="")
p
```

## Conclusion for hypothesis 8
