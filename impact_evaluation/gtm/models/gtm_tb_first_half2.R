#
# model: gtm_tb_first_half1 adapted by J Ross from drc_malaria1 code by D Phillips.
# model: gtm_tb_first_half2 modified by Emily Linebarger. All first half variables changed to cumulative
#   sums, and model linkages where data was unavailable were removed. 
# This is a computationally viable model that adapts the DRC malaria SEM for the GTM TB context
# May 2019
#
# In-process regression equations are indicated with the #, which I remove once variable names are formalized
# My current convention is to group funding by module ordered within module by GF, GHE, and DAH
